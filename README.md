# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This repository presents a professional end-to-end machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The project demonstrates a structured workflow from data preprocessing to actionable business insights.

## Project Objective

The primary goal is to identify customers at risk of leaving the company, enabling proactive retention strategies and optimizing customer lifetime value.

## Data Processing

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and removing irrelevant columns.  
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Encoding categorical features (label encoding and one-hot encoding)  
  - Scaling numerical features with MinMaxScaler  
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Understanding feature distributions and correlations with churn.

## Modeling

Three machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared:

- **Logistic Regression**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  

Models were evaluated on multiple metrics to ensure reliability and predictive accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics

- Confusion Matrix  
- Accuracy Score  
- ROC Curve and AUC  
- Precision-Recall Curve and F1 Score  
- Feature Importance / Feature Weights  

## Business Insights

- **Tenure** and **contract type** significantly affect churn.  
- **Pricing**, **service offerings**, and **billing preferences** influence customer loyalty.  
- Predictive modeling allows early identification of at-risk customers to implement retention strategies.  

## Strategic Recommendations

- Engage customers with short tenure through onboarding programs.  
- Promote long-term contracts and personalized billing.  
- Bundle services and enhance support offerings.  
- Leverage predictive analytics to target high-risk customers effectively.
